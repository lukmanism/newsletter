Pommo templating system has drastically changed. It used to use smarty, but since
it made it difficult for developers to understand it has been changed to plain
php.

Pommo_Template works the same way as it used to. The difference is in the call
to the "display" function.

How it used to be:

$view->display('configure.tpl');

How it is now:

$view->display('configure');

Smarty used the .tpl extension for its templates, now we are going to use plain
php files. The extension is added by the display function, so you should only
pass the name of the template.

Since the template file is now php you don't have to learn smarty to display
your views. You can do anything you need with the php you are already familiar
with.

When you assign a variable to a view you can access it as an attribute of $this
in the template file.

If you assign a value in your controller like this:

$view->assign('title', 'I am the title');

You could access it from your view like this:

<?php
	echo '<h1>'.$this->title.'</h1>';
?>

You can pass string, numbers, arrays, etc... and show them however you want
using php.
