Im trying to improve the quality of pommo by creating automatic tests that can
tell us when we break something.
I am putting this tests in the "tests" folder in the Pommo root dir. If you are
an end user you can erase that folder without worries.

I am using phpunit for the tests, so if you want to run them you will need to
install it.

The tests will play with the database information, so if you have information
there that you dont want to lose. DON'T RUN THE TESTS.
